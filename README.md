# Budokai-Modding-Tool-V2
The newest version of the Budokai Tool is in place!

This version will include newer versions of current tools available, but the aim is for the tools to be brought with a GUI!

-----------[Features]-----------

Model Editing

Texture Editing

Animation Editing

SLXS Editing

Effect Editing

Core ISO Editing

Tutorials and Instructions



-----------[Extras]------------

Language Options for Tool

Music/SFX Options for Tool

Graphical Themes for Tool

Mod Generators (ideas for mods!)



-----------[Process]-----------

This tool will be coded in Python 3.7 or higher using libraries such as Struct, Tkinter and similar.

This tool will be GUI only, this will make using the tools much better for people to mod and create mods without complication and struggle with the text aspect of the older tool.

This tool set will be standalone but can have "DLC" so to speak, meaning that anyone who wants to release their tools with this tool pack using it's files are welcome to post, but the core toolset will be developed by those within the team.



--------[Documentation]-------

This will be better documented and built so that those who are interested to develop can understand what this project is and how it can be managed, as well as also being useful for those who want to understand the tool better via tutorials and instructions of the tool.
